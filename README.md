# Message Redaction
A program that removes all desired letters from any user-entered sentence or phrase.

This program...
*	Takes a sentence or phrase as input,
*	Takes a comma-separated list of letters to remove as input,
*	Replaces all occurrences of each target letter in the user-entered sentence, regardless of 
case sensitivity, with an underscore (“_”) character.
*	Displays the number of letters removed to the user,
	

The program will keep asking the user to enter a new sentence until the user enters the command ‘quit’.
